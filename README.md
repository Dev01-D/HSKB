# HSKB – Happy Sabi KeyBoard

The **HSKB – Happy Sabi Key Board** is a custom mechanical keyboard inspired by the legendary **HHKB** and fueled by a passion for thoughtful design and community support. This project has been a personal journey—learning new software, iterating through several prototypes, and spending approximately **three months** refining every detail.

I am excited to share the HSKB with the open-source community and hope it inspires others to create and contribute.

## About the HSKB

The **HSKB** is a custom keyboard inspired by the minimalist layout and functionality of the **HHKB** (Happy Hacking Keyboard). It embraces the philosophy of simplicity, precision, and personal expression.

This project wouldn't have been possible without the support and inspiration from the keyboard community.

## Unity Switch & Andy's Man Club

This project is also inspired by **Matty's Unity switch**, created in support of **Andy's Man Club**, a mental health charity promoting open conversations and community support. As part of this commitment, one of the five initial HSKBs will be donated to a charity raffle to raise funds for this meaningful cause.

If you use or modify this project, please consider supporting **Andy's Man Club** or a mental health charity in your community.
