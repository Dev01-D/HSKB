# HSKB – Happy Sabi KeyBoard

![Alt text](Images/image_5.webp)



## About the HSKB

The HSKB is a custom mechanical keyboard inspired by the minimalist layout and functionality of the HHKB (Happy Hacking Keyboard). It reflects a philosophy of simplicity, precision, and personal expression.

Designed with a true HHKB layout, the HSKB features a 6u spacebar and an integrated plate design that supports both plate-mounted and PCB-mounted stabilizers. Drawing inspiration from the legendary HHKB and driven by a passion for thoughtful design and community collaboration, this project has been a personal journey—learning new software, iterating through multiple prototypes, and spending approximately three months refining every detail.

I am excited to share the HSKB with the open-source community and hope it inspires others to create and contribute. This project would not have been possible without the support and inspiration from the keyboard community.

## Why Choose the HSKB?

Many keyboards with a similar HHKB-inspired layout are often positioned as luxury items, carrying a high price tag and limited customization options. The HSKB offers a more affordable entry point without sacrificing quality or flexibility. Its open-source nature means you can modify and adapt it to suit your preferences—whether it's changing the key mapping, adjusting the stabilizers, or customizing the case.

The HSKB provides a unique balance of cost-efficiency and personalization. It's an excellent option for enthusiasts looking to explore the HHKB layout without breaking the bank. Whether you're new to mechanical keyboards or an experienced hobbyist, the HSKB offers a rewarding, hands-on experience while remaining accessible and adaptable.

## Unity Switch & Andy's Man Club

This project is also inspired by **Matty's Unity switch**, created in support of **Andy's Man Club**, a mental health charity promoting open conversations and community support. As part of this commitment, one of the five initial HSKBs will be donated to a charity raffle to raise funds for this meaningful cause.

If you use or modify this project, please consider supporting **Andy's Man Club** or a mental health charity in your community.
